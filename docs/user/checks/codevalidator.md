Codevalidator Check
-------------------

This check runs [codevalidator](https://github.com/hjacobs/codevalidator) on added and modified files.

By default this check uses your general codevalidator configuration, but you can also provide a custom codevalidatorc by
adding it as `.codevalidatorc` to your repository root.
